### **Pervasive Intelligence Lab**  
**January 2024 – Present | Department of Computing, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University**  



#### Key Contributions:  

- Contributed to the writing of a survey, conducted research on existing large models, and gained a fundamental understanding of AI technologies.
- Practiced MCTS-related techniques and implemented a multi-model joint reasoning framework based on Tree-of-Thoughts, achieving similar reasoning capabilities in the 24-point task with 50% of inference costs.

### **Artificial Intelligence for Affective Interaction**  
**Sept 2024 – Present | School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**  



#### Key Contributions:  

- Participated in research on text controllable generation based on Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), using SAE to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space to achieve style disentanglement, enabling fine-grained control over text generation.
- Engaged in affective computing tasks, researched and attempted to reproduce stance detection frameworks.
- Participate in the construction and research of multimodal synthetic datasets, extending single-modal datasets into multimodal ones through digital human synthesis.
